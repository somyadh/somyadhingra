# Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my personal website, built using ReactJS and Chakra-UI. The website features technical blog posts and small "About Me" page. This website is more of playground for me to learn react as well as learn how to host your own nano blogging site

## Features

- Technical blog posts 
- "About Me" page providing a brief introduction
- Responsive design for seamless user experience across devices
- Built with ReactJS and Chakra-UI

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- Chakra-UI
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Git

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Main source code files
  - `components/`: Reusable React components
  - `pages/`: Individual page components
  - `App.js`: Main component and entry point
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the ReactJS application
  - `theme.js`: Extended theme of Chakra
  - `data.js`: works as data store of all published blogs

## Future Enhancements (in no particular order)
- Move the data store from file to proper database

- Continous UI improvements
- Revamp About me page
